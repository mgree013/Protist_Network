Title: Long transients and network structure effect persistence and spatial predator-prey dynamics in experimental microcosms

Authors: Matthew D. Green, Clara A. Woodie, Megan Whitesell, and Kurt E. Anderson

# Structure of Code

1) Orgnaize.data.R  organizes and merges data files. Also makes Table S1
2) Plotting.R makes all figures used in the manuscript (Fig. 2,3,5,7)
3) Occupnacy analysis.R runs the glm analysis for Table S2, S3
4) ext_col_phases_analysis.R runs analysis for ext/col dynamics through the phases (Table S6)
5) pred_ccup_analysis.R runs anlaysis for Table S7
6) Trophic_analysis.R runs anlaysis for Table S8
